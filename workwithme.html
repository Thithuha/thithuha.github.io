        "Who I am" 
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">Hi, I’m Chloe Nguyen, 24 yo, a UI/Web designer living in Paris. I’ve spent a year working in fashion e-commercial company <a class="lien" href="https://acanthe-paris.com" target="_blank">Acanthe Paris</a> as a web master in Paris. Currently, I work as a Junior UX/UI Designer at <a class="lien" href="https://boozt.com" target="_blank">Boozt.com</a><br></br>

          I have done three years in a multimedia school (IESA), with a specialization in multimedia design, in Paris, France.<br></br>

        After my school, and spending wonderful years in the graphic studio with the team, I’ve decided that it was time to focus on creating Ui  . I want to create my own experience and I want it to be as strong as it can. That is why I learnt French in the <a class="lien" href="https://paris.si.se" target="_blank">Institute in Paris</a>.</p><br></br>
      <h1 class="h2">
        What I do
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">  In my school years I worked for a SaaS start-up and two fashion e-commercial comapnies , I took all the experience I could from it and I enjoyed practicing, improving my skills in it.<br></br>
       I have several skill sets, use all the Adobe creative suite, I have worked a lot on web design, social media content and video for different brand, or also photo editing for <a class="lien" href="https://www.leslipfrancais.fr" target="_blank">Le Slip Français</a>.<br></br>
       Graphic design like brand identity, graphic charts, infography or logo design is also a part of design I like to put my efforts in. I’ve always had a fascination for the web and I built this website by myself. Now I'm happy to start a new career as UI-Web designer. If I should sum up who I am on a professional side, I would say I’m a minimalist but effective designer to hire :)</p><br></br>
       <h1 class="h2">
        What I want
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">My dream since I am young is to be a person who works in arts and graphic design especially, and after the web which take a real importance to me. I have done everything I could to reach this purpose.<br></br>
But I always had another big passion. Travel. I grew up  and experience life with this passion.<br></br>
        Now to me, it’s a reality!</p><br></br>
      <h1 class="h2">
