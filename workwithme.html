        "Who I am" 
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">Hi, I’m ThiThuha-Chloe Nguyen, 24 yo, a UI/Web designer living in Paris. Currently, I am looking for great opportunies to be as a Junior UI/WEB Designer.<br></br>

          I have done three years in a multimedia school (IESA Multimédia Paris), with a specialization in graphic-Ui design, in Paris.<br></br>

      <h1 class="h2">
        What I do
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">  In my school years I worked for a SaaS start-up specialized in Real Estate software and two fashion-technology comapnies , I took all the experience I could from it and I enjoyed practicing, improving my skills in it.<br></br>
       I have several skill sets, use all the Adobe creative suite, then i found in love with Skecth recently. I have worked on web design, social media content and GiF for different brands, or also photo editing.<br></br>
       Graphic design like brand identity, graphic charts, infography or logo design is also a part of design I like to put my efforts in. I’ve always had a fascination for the web and tech fields. Now I'm happy to start a new career as UI-Web designer. If I should sum up who I am on a professional side, I would say I am a minimalist but effective designer to hire :)</p><br></br>
       <h1 class="h2">
        What I want
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraphe">My dream since I am young is to be a person who works in arts and graphic design especially, and after the web which take a real importance to me. I have done everything I could to reach this purpose.<br></br>
But I always had another big passion. Travel. I grew up  and experience life with this passion.<br></br>
      </p><br></br>
